## TODO
- [ ] Find a better way to manage themes & color overrides (specifically color overrides)
- [X] Finish lspsaga support
- [ ] Customize the netrw menu
- [ ] Find a good easymotions-like plugin (jump via character match instead of line number)
- [X] Fix bug with GitSigns sidebar where gitsign characters have different background highlight than normal background
- [ ] Rewrite customized cmp overrides in a better way (currently using a bunch of vim.cmd highlight lines)
- [ ] Add extra smart logic for lexima plugin (Ex. Don't create 2 spaces in markdown file when creating checkmark, etc.)
